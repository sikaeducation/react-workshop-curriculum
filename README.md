# Single-Page Application Development With React

## Core Ideas

These are the core abstract concepts explored in the workshop:

* One-way data flow
* Componentization

These two ideas are explored through many different applications. Regardless of your background, you should come out of the workshop able to speak to these two concepts at a deeper level than you can now.

## Diagnostic

Before you begin this workshop, do two things:

1. Fork and clone the [vocabulary](https://github.com/sikaeducation/react-workshop-vocabulary) repo and attempt to fill out as much of the sheet as you can.
2. Fork and clone the [Google Search Results](https://github.com/sikaeducation/google-search-results-react) exercise and get as far as you can.

It's OK if you can't get very far through either repo! You'll keep the vocabulary sheet updated throughout the workshop as you learn and refine, and the Google Search Results exercise helps me better understand where you're starting from.

## Standards

These are the skills we'll work toward in this workshop:

* [Build static pages using React](standards/build-static-pages-react)
* [Build dynamic pages using React](standards/build-dynamic-pages-react)
* [Integrate routing into a single-page application](standards/integrate-routing-react)
* [Integrate state management into a single-page application](standards/integrate-state-management-react)

Each standard has:

* Topic articles that support the skill
* Additional resources for each topic. Don't skip over these! The topic articles are focused and include the most important pieces of the topic, but the resources go into each in much more depth.
* Exercises for each topic
* Vocabulary for each topic
* A longer-form assessment for each skill

Everyone is starting from a different place so it's normal for everyone to end in a different place also. If you're new to React, you will likely get through the first standard and some of the second over the course of the workshop. If you're already experienced with React, you may be able to get through all 4 standards. Note that it's much more valuable to be able to confidently apply the concepts from one standard than it is to have a passing familiarity with all 4. Start at the beginning and be patient with yourself.
